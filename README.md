Astrolabe
=========

The astrolabe is an ancient astronomical calculator. It represents a projection of the night sky (celestial sphere) onto a plane, along with a local coordinate system. Aligning these things can tell you where objects in the sky can be found at a given time and date, or you can figure out the time or date from measuring the position of objects in the sky. The original smart phone.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome.
